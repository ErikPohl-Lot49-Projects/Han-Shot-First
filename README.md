# Han-Shot-First


Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [x] Apply this checklist to all new projects as step one
- [x] A complete regression test suite in UnitTest (with homegrown parameterized testing)
- [x] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [x] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [x] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
  - [x] Specifically, would this benefit from comprehensive logging?
  - [x] Would it benefit from a results page with stats to demonstrate accurate and complete results?
  - [x] How do I want to manage output to stdout, stderr, file, etc?
  - [x] How do comments and outputs help and assist one another without being redundant?
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [x] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization like PEP8 or Applying a PEP formatter to the code like Project Black.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [x] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
- [x] Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown which tell a code narrative. 
- [ ] For custom classes, create dunders as appropriate
- [ ] Make good decisions relating to
  - [ ] Exceptions versus return values
  - [ ] Using idiomatic Python versus clarity of code
  - [ ] Extend this list
  - [ ] Having functions return values -- as a default-- have a good reason not to
